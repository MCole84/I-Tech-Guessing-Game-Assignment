# I-Tech-Guessing-Game-Assignment

ITech homework assignment from Starting out in C# 2012. The assignment in the book was to create a guessing game where the computer chose a random number between 1 and 100 then report how many guesses the player took to correctly guess the answer. Modified it so that at any point the user could modify the range value to make the game as easy or hard as they wanted. If the user put invalid information in the range boxes , such as the setting low value to a number higher than the high value, it would default to the range between 1 and 100.
